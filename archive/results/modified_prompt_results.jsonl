Look for details you may have missed.\n\nThe non-corners of each row and column feature:\n- A plain outline of a shape (no smaller shape inside).\n- A solid shape with a contrasting smaller shape inside (X in a circle, star in a triangle).\n\nThe solid shapes in the corners:\n- Square with X, circle with star, and a star (bottom-left), which is not in a shape.\n\nStep 4: Come up with a hypothesis.\n\nThe pattern suggests that each row and each column must contain one of each type of shape (square, circle, triangle) and one of each type of smaller shape (X, star, or empty/no smaller shape). Given that the last row already has a star and the last column already has a circle and a triangle, the empty box must be a square with either no smaller shape or with an X.\n\nHowever, since the X is used in the top-left square, the pattern should not repeat within the same row or column. Therefore, the empty box in the bottom row cannot have an X inside.\n\nStep 5: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself. Run the test.\n\nTesting our hypothesis against the alternative shapes:\n- Option A (triangle with star) is not viable because there's already a triangle with a star in the same column.\n- Option B (triangle with plus) can be eliminated because we need a square, not a triangle.\n- Option C (circle with X) has a circle, which we already have in the same row, so it's not a fit.\n- Option D (circle with star) is also a circle, which isn't required.\n- Option E (plain triangle) is not a square shape.\n- Option F (triangle with X) is again not a square.\n\nNone of the given alternatives (A-F) are a square without a smaller shape or with a different small shape (other than an X). The correct shape according to the visible pattern would be a plain square with no smaller shape, which is not presented as an option. There seems to be an error as none of the alternative shapes can logically complete the pattern based on the given grid and the rules we derived.\n\nHowever, if we overlook the repetition of the X in a square and the necessity of having a non-repeating smaller shape, then Option F (triangle with X) could be the next best choice despite being a triangle, not a square. Since we know the empty shape can't be a circle or a star (from the options given), Option F would then be the only one featuring an X, potentially hinting toward an alternate pattern we did not initially consider.

Following that pattern, if the third pattern is a simple outer shape, the missing box should have an outer shape matching the other two in its row, in this case, a circle, but with no inner shape.\n\nStep 5: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself.

There should be an option showing a circle with no inner shape to follow the established sequence.\n\nHowever, since the closest shape to having a circle with no inner shape is option D (a circle with a star), we may need to adjust our hypothesis and consider if we might have missed a secondary pattern. \n\nUpon reviewing the patterns again, we need to adjust our hypothesis to account for all observed details. The missing detail is that each row alternates the inner shape. In the first box of each row, the inner shape is different from the second. The second box repeats the inner shape from the first box of the previous row. Thus, following this pattern, since the first box of the second row had an X (like the inner shape of the first box of the first row), and the first box of the third row has a star (like the inner shape of the first box of the second row), the empty slot would follow the pattern and need to be a circle with an X inside it.\n\nSo the corrected hypothesis is that the missing piece should be a circle with an inner X, matching option C.\n\nAnswer: C."}

Look for details you may have missed.\n\nUpon a second look:\n- The first column goes from a square to a square with an X inside to a star, which is the inner shape of the square with the X inside.\n- The second column goes from a circle with a star inside to a circle with an X inside to an empty circle, following the pattern of the inner shapes decreasing in complexity.\n- The third column should follow a similar pattern based on the first two, showing progression in shape or inner symbol.\n\nStep 4: Come up with a hypothesis.\n\nThe pattern suggests that the inner shapes are a key part of this sequence. Each row seems to use elements from the previous row. The third row appears to utilize the inner shapes from the squares in the first column as outer shapes and it follows the minimalistic pattern observed in the circles from the second column. So the last shape should be a triangle with decreasing complexity.\n\nStep 5: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself.
