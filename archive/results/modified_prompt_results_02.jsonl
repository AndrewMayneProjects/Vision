Run the tests.\n", "output": "To solve the puzzle, let's first look for a pattern in the given grid:\n\n1. In the first column, the shapes inside the squares progress from a solid X, to an empty square, to a solid star. \n2. In the second column, the shapes within the circles progress from a solid star, to an X, to an empty circle.\n3. In the third column, the shapes are triangles, with a progression likely following the pattern of the other two columns \u2013 first solid (filled triangle), then an X inside, so logically, we should expect an empty triangle to complete the sequence.\n\nLooking at the alternative shapes, the one that fits this pattern is an empty triangle without any additional marks inside it.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nAnswer: E."}
