Using that pattern for the last row of shapes:\n\n- First row: Solid symbol ('X'), solid symbol (star), outline (triangle).\n- Second row: Outline (square), solid symbol ('X'), solid symbol (star no border but inside a shape).\n- Third row should follow: Solid symbol (star), outline (circle), solid symbol within a triangle border.\n\nSince we need the last shape to complete the pattern in the third row and it should be a triangle with a solid symbol inside, the alternative shape F fits this description: a triangle with an 'X' inside.\n\nTherefore, the prediction would be:\nAnswer: F"}

We can describe the outer shape, the inner symbol, and the overall pattern we might discern row by row or column by column. We will describe the grid row-wise:\n\n- First row:\n  - Box 1: Squared border with a cross inside.\n  - Box 2: Circular border with a star inside.\n  - Box 3: Triangle with no border and no symbol inside.\n\n- Second row:\n  - Box 4: Square with no border and no symbol inside.\n  - Box 5: Circle with a border and a cross inside.\n  - Box 6: Triangle with a border and a star inside.\n\n- Third row:\n  - Box 7: Star with no border and no symbol inside.\n  - Box 8: Circle with no border and no symbol inside.\n  - Box 9: The box is empty, denoted by a question mark.\n\nNow let's check for patterns:\n\n- Looking at the first column, we see that the outer shapes are all different: square, square, star. It doesn't give us a clear sequence.\n- In the second column, the sequence of outer shapes is circle, circle, which suggests the third shape might also be a circle.\n- The third column is made up of shapes with no outer border: triangle, triangle, implying the empty box might also follow the same pattern (a shape with no border).\n\nConsidering the outer shapes and the second column's consistent use of circles, let's examine the alternatives to see which one matches a circle with no border and inner symbol:\n\n- A: Triangle with a border and a star inside (doesn't match the pattern).\n- B: Triangle with a border and a plus inside (doesn't match the pattern).\n- C: Circle with a border and a cross inside (doesn't match because of the border).\n- D: Circle with a border and a star inside (doesn't match because of the border).\n- E: Triangle with no border and no symbol inside (doesn't match the shape).\n- F: Triangle with a border and a cross inside (doesn't match the pattern).\n\nIt seems none of the provided alternatives perfectly match the expected pattern of a circle with no border. However, the closest match considering the shape consistency from the second column and ignoring the borders would be the circle. Since there's no option with a circle without a border, we will select the one with the least additional detail, which would be a circle with something inside. None of the alternatives is a perfect match, but if we must choose the one that fits the most based on consistent shape alone, ignoring the border:\n\nAnswer: C"}
