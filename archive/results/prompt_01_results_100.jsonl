For example, the inner shapes rotate from X, to star, to none, and the outer shapes rotate from square, to circle, to none (triangle).\n\nIf we follow this hypothesis, the pattern seems to repeat every three items. So, following this sequence, after the square and circle, an outer shape is not to be expected (which lines up with the triangles we see), and after the X and star, the inner shape should be none (which also aligns with the middle and right columns).\n\nNow let's look at the bottom row specifically, as that's where the missing element is. Looking at the rows above it:\n- First column: Square with X, Empty square, Square with star\n- Second column: Circle with star, Circle with X, Empty circle\n\nThe bottom row thus far has a square and then a circle, both of which are empty.\n\nStep 4: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself. Run the test.\nIf we need a triangle to match the pattern of no outer shape and the sequence suggests it should have no inner shape following the star, the only matching alternative shape is a plain triangle without an inside shape or border, which is option E.\n\nAnswer: E"}

For instance, no two similar fillings or shapes appear twice in any row or column.\n- The missing shape in the bottom right cannot be a square, circle, or triangle as each shape already appears in the column and row of the empty spot. However, there are only three shapes available, so one of them must repeat in the column or the row of the missing shape.\n- The fillings of the shapes shift between an X, an empty space, and a star. Each filling is represented in each row and column without repetition.\n- Since the bottom row already has a star and the bottom right column already has an X, the missing filling must be an empty space.\n\nStep 4: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself.

The circle cannot have an X as there is already one in the column, and can't have a star, so it must be empty \u2013 but there is already an empty circle in the row. Therefore, the shape cannot be a circle.\n- The triangle, therefore, could fit into the missing spot if it does not have an X (which already exists in the column) or a star (which is in the row).

Another pattern might be the alternation of the shapes inside the figures: cross, star, and then an empty space or a different shape appears.\n\nStep 4: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself. Run the test.\n\nTesting the pattern of solid and outline shapes, we can see that the first column is all squares, the second one all circles, and the third one has to follow the pattern with another shape, which in the grid appears to be alternating squares. Hence, the bottom right one has to be a square (solid or outline).\n\nConsidering the inside shapes, we can also test this. The first row has the sequence of cross, star, triangle, the second row has none, cross, star. So, for the third row, following the pattern none, cross, it should be expected that the next shape is the star.\n\nTherefore, based on these patterns, the shape that should be in the empty box to complete the pattern is a square with a star inside it.\n\nLooking at the alternative shapes, the one that matches this description is D: Circle with a star inside. However, our hypothesis stated that we should expect a square, not a circle. Evidently, I must have made an error in describing the options. I apologize for the mistake and let's rectify this:\n\nA - Triangle with a star inside.\nB - Triangle with a plus inside.\nC - Circle with a cross inside.\nD - Circle with a star inside.\nE - Triangle outline.\nF - Triangle with a cross inside.\n\nSince we're looking for a square, not a circle or a triangle, there is no square with a star inside it within the alternatives. This implies there might be another pattern or rule we need to consider for a proper solution.\n\nUpon closer inspection and considering the pattern of the internal shapes: cross, star, triangle, and sequence of solid and outline shapes from the top left, we can see the following progression:\n\n1st row: Solid, Solid, Outline\n2nd row: Outline, Outline, Solid\n\nIf this pattern of alternating between solid and outline while also alternating the internal shapes continues, then the 3rd row should follow as:\n\n3rd row: Solid, Outline, Solid\n\nAnd the solid shape should contain the shape not used in the third row yet - a cross. Checking the alternatives for a solid square with a cross inside, we can now identify the correct shape, which is actually C.\n\nAnswer: C."}
