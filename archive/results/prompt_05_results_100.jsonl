It looks like every column has all three different inner shapes, and every row has all three different outer shapes.\n\nStep 3: Come up with a hypothesis.\n\nConsidering the empty box is in the bottom right corner of the grid, you need a shape that has not yet appeared in the bottom row and the right column as an outer shape. The bottom row is missing a triangle, and the right column is missing an empty shape as the inner shape. \n\nStep 4: Create a test based on your hypothesis.\n\nTo test the hypothesis, see if the shape with a triangle as the outer shape and empty as the inner shape fits the criteria:\n- For the bottom row, the outer shapes would be Square, Circle, Triangle \u2014 all different.\n- For the right column, the inner shapes would be Empty, Star, Empty \u2014 but we need three different ones. \n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems my hypothesis was incorrect, as the right column actually needs a shape that isn't empty or star, so it must be a cross.\n\nTesting again, consider this correction:\n- For the bottom row, the outer shape still needs to be a Triangle.\n- For the right column, the inner shape needs to be a Cross.\nTherefore, the shape we're looking for is a triangle with a cross inside.\n\nLet's look at the alternative shapes and find a triangle with a cross inside:\n- Shape B fits this description.\n\nThe triangle outer shape is missing from the bottom row, and the cross inner shape is missing from the right column.\n\nHence, according to the pattern in the grid:\n\nAnswer: B."}

Since there is no perfect match, we might consider the possibility of a shape missing from the alternatives or that the criterion for the shape inside the patterns is different than originally hypothesized. Reexamining the grid doesn't seem to provide any other consistent patterns.\n\nHowever, let's consider the pattern in a different way. Rather than focusing solely on the shape of the symbols, if we look at the filled and unfilled nature of the symbols, then we can consider a pattern that involves filled, empty, filled symbols inside the outer shape. With that consideration, the outer shape should be a circle, and the inner shape should be a filled shape since the previous two in the row are an unfilled star and an unfilled cross.\n\nIf we were to strictly adhere to this pattern and considering the available options, we could look for an option that presents a circle with a filled shape inside.
