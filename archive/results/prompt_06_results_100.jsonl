In the first column, the pattern appears to be a solid shape within the larger shape, then an empty space, then a solid shape again. Following this pattern, since the first row has X in the square and the second row has an empty square, it would suggest the star, which has not been used in the star yet, would be in the star shape for the third row.\n\nMoreover, the outer shapes in column three are also consistent, with each geometric shape appearing once in each row.
