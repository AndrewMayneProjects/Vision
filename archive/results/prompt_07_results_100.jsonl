The first column has different shapes in each box, starting with a square with an X, then just a square, and finally a standalone star. If I interpret this as a reduction in complexity (from a shape with a symbol, to just a shape, to just a symbol), then perhaps the missing item should follow this trend and be even simpler than just a star. There is no clear option for \"simpler than just a star\" though amongst the alternative shapes.\n\n2.

Finally, the third column starts with a plain triangle, then a triangle with a star, which suggests the pattern could involve adding a symbol inside the shape each time, or alternating shapes and symbols inside the shapes.\n\nThe hypothesis that is emerging involves noticing the alternation of symbols inside the shapes and the progression from filled shapes to empty shapes. In the first column, there's a symbol within a shape, then just a shape, then just a symbol. In the second column, the circle contains different symbols and then is presented empty.\n\nFor my test, I will look to see if one of the alternative shapes matches the expected pattern for the third column, assuming that there should be an X inside a shape because the sequence seems to alternate between plain and symbol-filled.\n\nBased on what I can see, the third item in the last column seems to need an X inside a shape, judging by the pattern.

This row starts with a filled shape (square), followed by a different filled shape (circle), ending with an unfilled shape (triangle).\n- The second row contains an empty square, a circle with an X, and a triangle with a star.

There's a progression from a square to a shape within a shape to just the shape.\n- The second column has a filled shape with a star, a filled shape with an X, and an unfilled shape (circle). The progression seems to follow the filling of the shapes and the inner symbols.\n- The third column has an empty shape (triangle), a filled shape with an inner symbol (triangle with a star), and the unknown shape.\n\nThe pattern seems to involve alternating between filled and unfilled shapes and alternating symbols within those shapes across rows, while within columns, there seems to be a logical progression of shapes or symbols changing from filled to empty, with inner symbols (X, star) also following a pattern.\n\nTherefore, the shape in the empty third row must be a filled shape with an inner symbol, as it follows the pattern of the second column: filled, filled with a symbol, and then empty. The correct shape also needs to fit the pattern of alternating filled/unfilled shapes across the row, and it appears that it should be a filled shape since the other two in the row are a filled and then an unfilled shape.\n\nBased on this hypothesis, let's see which of the alternative shapes (A-F) fits:\n\n- A: Triangle filled with a star - follows pattern by shape type but not by new symbol.\n- B: Triangle filled with a plus - follows the pattern by shape but introduces a new symbol (plus) that has not been seen elsewhere.\n- C: Circle filled with an X - follows the pattern of a filled shape with an X, but does not offer a new shape type, as we already have a circle in the middle column.\n- D: Circle filled with a star - already seen in the first row, so it does not fit the pattern of new shapes in each row.\n- E: Empty triangle - does not follow the pattern as it's unfilled.\n- F: Triangle filled with an X - follows the pattern by offering a filled shape with a familiar symbol (X), and it hasn't appeared in the column before.\n\nConsidering the hypothesis that each column should have distinct shapes and the middle one should be a filled shape with one of the inner symbols we have seen thus far (star or X), the only option that fulfills these conditions is F: Triangle filled with an X.\n\nTherefore, after running the hypothesis test, the correct prediction is:\nAnswer: F"}

Observing the rows and columns, we can see a pattern in shapes and the presence of symbols:\n\n- The first column has different shapes following a sequence: Square, Square, Star.\n- The second column consists of circles, with the circles filled with different symbols: Star, X, ?.\n- The third column contains triangle shapes, starting with a plain triangle, then a triangle with a star, followed by the empty box.\n\nThe hypothesis here is that each shape rotates through a square, circle, and triangle within each row and column, while the symbols inside (X, star or plain) also follow a specific rotating pattern. The first row alternates between a symbol and plain, the second row alternates between a symbol inside the shapes and plain shapes, and the third row should now alternate with the pattern:\n\n- In the first row, there is a symbol, symbol, plain.\n- In the second row, the pattern seems to be plain, symbol, symbol.\n- We can thus predict that in the third row, the pattern could be symbol, plain, symbol.\n\nThe plain shapes in the second column (plain square and plain circle) suggests that the shape in the third row's second column should also be plain (not having a symbol inside).
