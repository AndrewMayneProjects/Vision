The pattern suggests that we have a change in both shape and symbol while moving from left to right.\n- The second row shows a transition from an empty square to a circle containing a cross, ending in a triangle with a star. Here, we're alternating between being empty and having a symbol, with a consistent transition in shapes from square to circle to triangle.\n\nBy applying this pattern to the third row, we would look for the following transition:\n\n- Starting with a square containing a star, moving to an empty circle, we should end with a triangle containing a symbol since the pattern alternates between being empty and having a symbol. Given that the other symbols used in the previous triangles are a star and an empty triangle, the logical choice for the symbol would be a cross (X), as it is the only other symbol present in the grid that hasn't been used in a triangle yet.\n\nLet's run the test:\nThe next shape should be a triangle with a cross to preserve the alternation between empty and containing a symbol while moving to the next shape in the sequence (triangle).\n\nLooking at the alternatives, the only option that fits this description is choice F, which is a triangle containing a cross (X).\n\nTherefore, based on the observed pattern, the hypothesis, and the test, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: F."}

Triangle with a small star inside.\nB. Triangle with a plus (+) inside.\nC. Circle with a cross inside.\nD. Circle with a large star inside.\nE. Empty triangle.\nF. Triangle with a cross inside.\n\nHypothesis:\n- Each row seems to have a different shape, and each column has unique features inside that shape.\n- The first row has crosses and stars inside squares and circles, and nothing inside the triangle.\n- The second row has empty shapes of square, circle, and triangle.\n- The third row has stars inside square and circle.\n\nBased on the hypothesis:\n\n- First column: Shapes inside squares - cross, empty, star\n- Second column: Shapes inside circles - star, empty, star\n- Third column: Shapes inside triangles - empty, empty, ?\n\nFor completion and consistency, the column with triangles should follow the pattern and the empty space should be filled with an empty shape since we have already one filled shape (star) and one empty. So, we need a triangle to maintain the structure, and for pattern consistency, we should expect it to be empty.\n\nTesting the hypothesis:\n- The only empty triangle provided in the alternatives is option E.\n\nConclusion:\nOption E is the correct shape for the empty box since it is the only empty triangle, which completes the pattern.\n\nAnswer: E."}

Furthermore, the X inside the square becomes a star inside the circle.\n- In Row 2, there's an empty square, an X inside a circle, and an empty triangle.\n- In Row 3, there is a progression from a star to an empty circle, suggesting that the pattern involves an empty triangle or a triangle containing a star or X to complete the sequence.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\n- Column 1: Square with X, empty Square, Star. There seems to be a simplification pattern where a shape inside a figure is removed leaving an empty figure and then the shape alone.\n- Column 2: Star inside a Circle, X inside a Circle, empty Circle. This shows a change in the shape inside the figure, and the next in sequence should be a figure with a different shape inside it.\n- Column 3: Triangle, Triangle with a star, ?. This follows the logic found in row 1, where the isolated shape progresses to being inside a figure.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nBased on the above organization and notes, the pattern suggests that the third row could be completed with a symbol that is a triangle (since the empty circle is missing its internal shape, just as the square lost its X and the star appears alone).\n\nRunning the test:\n\nWe look at the alternative shapes (A to F) to find one that best fits the identified patterns:\n\n- A has a triangle with the star inside.\n- B is a triangle with a plus sign (+) inside.\n- C is a circle with an X inside.\n- D is a circle with a star inside.\n- E is an empty triangle.\n- F is a triangle with an X inside.\n\nGiven that we observe a simplification pattern in the other columns, where a figure loses its inside shape and then the shape alone appears, the empty triangle (shape E) is what logically fits, since the star has already appeared alone, and we are left with an empty circle and then an empty triangle as the final figure without any symbol inside.\n\nAnswer: E"}

The patterns might be related to the shape inside and the shape outside:\n\n1. Outlines - The grid alternates between the square, circle, and triangle going from left to right, repeating every three boxes.\n   So, we can predict the bottom right corner (G9) will be a triangle.\n\n2. Inside Shapes - There are two types of symbols inside the shapes: crosses (X) and five-pointed stars. The crosses and stars alternate in vertical alignment, and an empty shape (no inside symbol) follows each pair.\n\nNow let's validate these observations:\nFor the outer shapes:\n- First row: Square, Circle, Triangle\n- Second row: Square, Circle, Triangle (observed pattern)\n- Third row: Based on the above, the third row should continue with Square, Circle, and therefore, Triangle.\n\nFor the inner shapes:\n- First column: Cross, None, Star\n- Second column: Star, Cross, None (following the same alternating pattern)\n- Third column: The sequence should therefore be: None, Star, and then Cross for G9.\n\nSo, we predict that G9 should be a triangle with a cross inside it.
