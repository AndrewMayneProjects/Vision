Notation:\n- Denote the shapes as S (Square), C (Circle), T (Triangle), and the contained symbols as X (cross), *(star), +(plus), and E (empty).\n- Using this, the grid can be represented as:\n  1st row - SX, C*, TE\n  2nd row - SE, CX, T*\n  3rd row - * (no shape), CE, ?\n\n4. Revisiting Consistency:\n- Symbols within shapes change from row to row, but the shape in the first column doesn't contain a shape in the third row.\n- Outer shapes in the first two columns repeat every other row: squares and circles.\n- Outer shapes in the third column: a star repeats in the first and second rows within different outer shapes; a cross is expected to repeat in the third row within a triangle because a cross is also in the second column in the third row.\n\n5. Hypothesis:\n- The pattern for the shapes is likely determined by the row they're in. Given the star is in a square and then no shape at all, it seems the pattern for the star could eliminate the surrounding shape progressively. Since the triangle hasn't been eliminated and the first two columns always display basic shapes, the third one might follow this theme but include the cross based on the pattern of the second column.\n\n6. Test Hypothesis:\n- Checking the alternatives for a triangle with a cross, only option F matches this description.

For example, the first row starts with an 'X' inside the square, followed by a star in the circle, and an empty triangle.
