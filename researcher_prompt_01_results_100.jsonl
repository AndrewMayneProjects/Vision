In the second row, we already have two X's, so the missing symbol in the empty box should also be an X.\n\nCombining both deductions, we need a shape that is a Circle with an X inside it.\n\nThe alternative shape that matches this description is C.\n\nAnswer: C."}

{"correct": "true", "last_line": "Answer: F.", "prompt": "There is a grid of 9 boxes, one of which is empty (marked as ?). You have to choose which of the 6 alternative shapes (A-F) should be placed in the empty box in order to complete the pattern that connects the shapes. Finally, provide your prediction as Answer: \u201cX\u201d.", "output": "To determine which shape belongs in the empty box, we have to identify the pattern connecting the shapes in the grid. Observing the grid, one plausible pattern is alternating shapes and fills between rows. The first row has a pattern of a black X in a shape, a solid black star in a shape, and then an empty shape. The second row has an empty shape, a black X in a shape, and then a solid black star in a shape.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the third row should consist of a solid black star in a shape, an empty shape, and then a black X in a shape to continue the alternation. The solid black star is in a square in the first row and in a circle in the third row, so for the third row, it should not repeat a shape already used with a solid star in the same column.\n\nSince the empty box is in the last position of the third row, it requires a black X within a shape. Since the shape should not repeat within the column and a square and circle have been used already, the shape must be a triangle.\n\nThe alternative shape that fits this pattern is option F, a black X within a triangle.\n\nAnswer: F."}
