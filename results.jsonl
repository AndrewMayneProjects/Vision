Outer shapes are box/square, circle, triangle, and star. Inner shapes/symbols are cross (X), star, or empty.\n\nStep 3: Come up with a hypothesis.\nA hypothesis could be that each row and column contains unique outer shapes and unique inner shapes or symbols. The first column contains a box, square, and star (in outer shapes). The second column contains a circle in all three rows. The third column has a triangle in the first two rows.\n\nThe first row has a cross, star, and empty space (in inner shapes).\nThe second row has an empty space, cross, and star (in inner shapes).\nThe third row has a star, an empty space, and a missing symbol.\n\nCombining the hypothesis about unique outer and inner shapes/symbols in each row and column, the third column should have a triangle with a cross inside, because there is already a triangle with a star and an empty triangle in the other two cells of the column.\n\nStep 4: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself. Run the test.\nLooking at the alternative shapes, the triangle with a cross inside (which is part of the hypothesis) is not present, so this hypothesis cannot be correct. Thus we need to establish a new pattern or rule. \n\nLet's consider another hypothesis, where each row seems to have one of each shape and one of each symbol:\n\nFirst row: Shapes: box, circle, triangle; Symbols: cross, star, empty.\nSecond row: Shapes: square, circle, triangle; Symbols: empty, cross, star.\nThird row: Shapes: star, circle, (missing); Symbols: empty, (missing), star.\n\nFor the third row, we're missing a square or box shape and a cross symbol. Therefore, the missing shape should be a square or box with a cross inside to satisfy the rule.\n\nTesting this against the alternative shapes, we find:\nShape A: Triangle with star: (already present in the grid)\nShape B: Triangle with plus: (triangle already present, plus not in the pattern)\nShape C: Circle with cross: (circle already present in the row)\nShape D: Circle with star: (circle already present in the row)\nShape E: Empty triangle: (already present in the grid)\nShape F: Triangle with cross: (correct shape, correct symbol not already in the row)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the shape that is not already represented in the row in outer or inner form.\n\nAnswer: F."}

Each box is characterized by an outer shape (square, circle, or triangle) and an inner symbol (X, star, empty).\n\nStep 3: Come up with a hypothesis.\n\nFrom the descriptions, a pattern suggests itself. In each row, there's a progression of the inner symbol: X, star, and then empty. Additionally, each row contains one of each outer shape: square, circle, and triangle.\n\nUsing this observation, the hypothesis is that the missing box should be the shape that complements the pattern. Since the first box of the bottom row is a square with a star, and the second box is an empty circle, the third box should be a triangle to maintain the outer shape pattern and should contain an \"X\" to maintain the inner symbol pattern.\n\nStep 4: Create a test based on your hypothesis \u2013 don't simply agree with yourself. Run the test.\n\nLooking at the alternative shapes:\n- A: Triangle containing a star. (Does not fit because there's already a star in the bottom row)\n- B: Triangle containing a plus symbol. (Incorrect, there's no plus symbol in the pattern)\n- C: Circle containing an \"X\". (Incorrect outer shape for the pattern)\n- D: Circle containing a star. (Incorrect outer shape and duplicate star in the bottom row)\n- E: Empty triangle. (Incorrect because it's not containing an \"X\")\n- F: Triangle containing an \"X\". (Correct outer shape and inner symbol according to the pattern)\n\nThe correct choice based on the hypothesis is:\n\nAnswer: F"}
